    Checks if the specified file at `relative_file_path` does exist in

    Mapping is paramount for some extension snaps like gtk-common-themes.
    In this specific case, the snap contains the `share` folder directly
    at its root folder, while any other snap would have it inside the
    `usr` folder. Thus, for that extension snap, the map must be `usr`
    to instruct this function to remove `usr` from the beginning of the
    relative path when checking for a file inside gtk-common-themes.

    ----------
    extensions_paths : array of tuples with two elements
        An array with tuples containing each one a string with the root
        path for one of the extensions snap, and, if required, another

    relative_file_path : string
        The file path to search in the folder list, relative to the
